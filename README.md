## 📝 About Me

I'm a Computer Science master’s student (Research Track) at the University at Buffalo (GPA: 3.92/4.0), focused on building **intelligent, scalable systems** that bridge applied research and real-world deployment.

My work spans **machine learning, computer vision, data engineering, and cloud-native development**. I enjoy taking ideas from experimentation to production — designing pipelines, training models, deploying services, and building user-facing applications.

At the **Artificial Intelligence Innovation Lab**, I work under Prof. David Doermann on smart city computer vision research, developing deep learning pipelines to detect real-time parking availability from CCTV-style video feeds. I’ve trained YOLO-based models using Python, PyTorch, and OpenCV, addressing challenges such as angled viewpoints, occlusions, and variable lighting.

Previously, as a **Software Developer Student Assistant**, I modernized a large legacy MATLAB simulation system by re-engineering over 5,000 lines of code into a scalable Python implementation, reducing runtime by 30% and overall complexity by 40%. At **Jio Platforms Ltd.**, I contributed to enterprise-scale data and machine learning pipelines processing petabyte-scale datasets, improving system performance by 50% and recommendation accuracy by 30%.

I enjoy building systems that are **thoughtful, testable, and measurable**, and I’m especially interested in applied AI, data platforms, and production ML systems.
